## Project Overview

Carrier frequency offset estimation is a crucial technique in wireless communications that compensates for frequency differences between transmitter and receiver oscillators. Traditional FPGA implementation approaches require significant manual effort to convert high-level algorithms into hardware description languages.

This project demonstrates an innovative approach to FPGA implementation of carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation algorithms for wireless communication systems. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate MATLAB algorithms into HLS C++, we achieve efficient hardware implementations with streamlined design space exploration.

## Methodology

### MATLAB to HLS C++ Conversion

The project demonstrates how LLMs can efficiently convert signal processing algorithms from MATLAB's high-level mathematical descriptions to HLS C++ code ready for FPGA implementation. This conversion preserves algorithmic integrity while enabling hardware-specific optimizations.

### CFO Estimation Algorithm

The carrier frequency offset estimation technique implemented in this project is based on complex signal autocorrelation. The algorithm:
1. Processes incoming complex signal samples
2. Computes autocorrelation to identify periodic patterns
3. Extracts phase information to estimate frequency offset
4. Provides correction factors to compensate for the offset

### Implementation Approaches

We explore multiple hardware implementation strategies:

1. **Flip-Flop-based shift registers**: Traditional approach using sequential elements
   - Direct mapping of algorithm to hardware registers
   - Simple implementation but potentially resource-intensive for large buffers

2. **LUT-based shift registers**: Optimized for specific FPGA architectures
   - Uses LUT-based shift register implementations (SRL)
   - More resource-efficient for medium-sized buffers

3. **Dual-port block RAM**: Memory-based implementation for improved resource utilization
   - Circular buffer implementation using block RAM
   - Most efficient for large buffer sizes but introduces additional latency

## Design Space Exploration

The project includes automated design space exploration to identify optimal implementation parameters:
- Buffer sizes and organizations
- Computation precision trade-offs
- Parallelization factors
- Memory vs. logic resource allocation

Our results demonstrate that dual-port block RAM implementations achieve the most resource-efficient designs for CFO estimation.
